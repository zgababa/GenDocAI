## Description

This code defines a function named "computeComplexOperation" that performs a complex operation on matrices and vectors.

The code starts by importing two functions, matrixMultiplication and matrixAddition, from the file "./under/a". These functions are used to perform matrix multiplication and addition, respectively.

Next, the code imports three functions, dotProduct, crossProduct, and vectorMagnitude, from the file "./outer/b". These functions are used to perform dot product, cross product, and calculate a vector's magnitude, respectively.

The "computeComplexOperation" function takes four arguments: "matrixA", "matrixB", "vector1", and "vector2".

Inside the function, the code performs the following operations:

1. It multiplies matrices "matrixA" and "matrixB" using the "matrixMultiplication" function and stores the result in the "matrixProduct" variable.
2. It adds matrices "matrixA" and "matrixB" using the "matrixAddition" function and stores the result in the "matrixSum" variable.
3. It calculates the dot product of vectors "vector1" and "vector2" using the "dotProduct" function and stores the result in the "dotProd" variable.
4. It calculates the cross product of vectors "vector1" and "vector2" using the "crossProduct" function and stores the result in the "crossProd" variable.
5. It calculates the magnitude of the "crossProd" vector using the "vectorMagnitude" function and stores the result in the "crossProdMagnitude" variable.
6. It multiplies each value of the "matrixSum" matrix by the dot product "dotProd" using the "map" method and stores the result in the "weightedMatrixSum" variable.
7. It multiplies the "weightedMatrixSum" matrix by the "matrixProduct" matrix using the "matrixMultiplication" function and stores the result in the "resultMatrix" variable.
8. It multiplies each value of the "resultMatrix" by the magnitude of the "crossProd" vector using the "map" method and stores the result in the "finalMatrix" variable.
9. It returns the "finalMatrix" as the result of the "computeComplexOperation" function.

Finally, the function "computeComplexOperation" is exported for use in other files.

## Code

```javascript
import { computeComplexOperation } from '../front/x'

export const updateUser = async (event: any) => {
  let matrixA = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
  ]
  let matrixB = [
    [10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18]
  ]
  let vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
  let vector2 = [4, 5, 6]
  const users = computeComplexOperation(matrixA, matrixB, vector1, vector2)
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      users: [users]
    })
  }
}

export default updateUser
```
